Racket is a simple reimbursement tracking system, originally designed to help me keep track
of things that my parents owed me money for.

## Features

- Upload reimbursements with names, amounts and links to a receipt


- Automatically send emails (default 3 times a week) to the person
paying with info on what's new and what's been previously requested
  

- Automatically sends person being paid reminder emails to check if they've
been paid and very easy closing if they have been


## Installation
